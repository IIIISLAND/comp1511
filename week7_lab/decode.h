Write a C program decode.c which decrypts text encrypted by substitution.c
For example:

./decode
qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
O vql leqktr gy rtfzolzl qfr zit rqka
I was scared of dentists and the dark
O vql leqktr gy hktzzn uoksl qfr lzqkzofu egfctklqzogfl
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

./decode
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
The identity cipher!!!
The identity cipher!!!
./decode
bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza
Uif Dbftbs djqifs jt b tvctfu pg uif tvctujuvujpo djqifs!
The Caesar cipher is a subset of the substitution cipher!

Your program will only be tested with an appropriate cipher input - but a good programmer would check the input is present and appropriate.
Manually Cracking a Substitution Cipher
This English text was encrypted with a substitution cipher.

What was the original text?
Hint: use frequency_analysis.c on the encrypted text and compare the frequencies to English letter frequencies and then try your guesses with decode.c

Oh so, you're weak or I am
You doubt I'll bother reading into it
I probably won't
Left to my own devices
But that's the difference in our opinions

You're a mouthful
That amounts for another week on my own
Now I'm a novel made resourceful
I start a chain with my thought

Talk is cheap, my darling
When you're feeling right at home
I wanna make you move with confidence
I wanna be with you alone
